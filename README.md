# VirtualLab
Educational institutions that use the latest technology in the classroom as well as in field trips are going to create a completely different learning experience opportunity for the children. With it, they are going to contribute to better prepare for the leaders of the future. Providing an engaging learning experience is paramount for the success of any educational institution, and in particular, the success of the educator. Thanks to emerging technologies such as Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR) the classroom today can incorporate AR and VR content that can make learning more efficient, faster, and much more fun. From mathematics to chemistry to biology with some creativity AR can be incorporated into practically any subject.
